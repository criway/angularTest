#### Learning curve
Takes some time to get the concept and really understand how angular2 works.
## Major features
#### Paradigm
Angular works with modules or components, kind of OOP. For a good use it needs a very well structured code, requires a pre-thinking on the way of transform our code into different components.
It has a CLI very useful that makes so easy to start project, but it runs on node, not apache.
#### Gains
In my opinion a OOP is a WIN. Implements types so it is easier to read and understand the code.
Once you get with the Angular2 concept, it is automatic to develop new features.
## Daily Use
#### Ease of use
Easy once you really understand Angular2.
#### Ease of debug
Browser errors are no so easy to follow.
#### Ease of migration/cohab from AngularJS
We can think in Components as a pack of Directive+Controller. Classes as Factories. So again, once you get the concept, it seems easy to migrate from AngularJS to Angular2
## Future
#### Updates
#### Long-term vision
Seems Angular2 is a nonstop growing framework so it will continue for a long period of time.
